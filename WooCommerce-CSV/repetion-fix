### Problem
WooCommerce failed to import products from the German-formatted CSV. Products either didn't import or appeared as "Produkte" without images, prices, or categories.

### Solution Documentation

**Root Cause:**
- German column headers (e.g., `Bilder`, `Regulärer Preis`) not recognized by WooCommerce
- Euro symbol (`€`) in price fields
- Redundant first row breaking column structure
- Image URLs improperly formatted (spaces/newlines instead of commas)

**Fix Applied:**
1.  **Removed** the problematic first row.
2.  **Translated headers** to English (e.g., `Bilder` → `Images`, `Regulärer Preis` → `Regular price`).
3.  **Cleaned prices** by removing the `€` symbol.
4.  **Formatted images** correctly: comma-separated URLs within one cell.
5.  **Simplified CSV** by keeping only essential columns (14 instead of 120+).
6.  **Added default category** ("Chairs") for all products.

**Result:**
Clean CSV file that imports successfully into WooCommerce with all product details intact.
